Feature Description:
Implement a service management system for the Safer Payment application using Consul for session-based leader election. The node elected as the leader will enable the BDI and API services on the cluster. Non-leader nodes will monitor for changes and take over leadership responsibilities in case the current leader goes down for rehydration, maintenance, or due to a crash.

Acceptance Criteria:
Consul Setup:

Consul must be installed and configured on all nodes in the cluster.
Consul agents must be running on each node to participate in the leader election process.
Leader Election:

Implement a session-based leader election process using Consul.
Only the elected leader node will enable the BDI and API services.
Non-leader nodes must monitor the leader status and be ready to take over if the leader goes down.
Service Management:

Create scripts or systemd service files to manage the BDI and API services.
Ensure that these services are only enabled on the leader node.
Failover Mechanism:

Non-leader nodes must continuously watch for changes in the leader status.
In the event of a leader failure (rehydration, maintenance, or crash), a new leader must be elected.
The new leader must enable the BDI and API services promptly.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Implement monitoring to track the status of the leader and the health of the services.
Configure alerts to notify the operations team of any leadership changes or service disruptions.
Testing and Validation:

Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the leader election process works as expected.
Validate that only the leader node enables the BDI and API services.
Test the failover mechanism by simulating leader node failures and ensuring a new leader is elected and services are enabled.
Tasks:
Consul Installation and Configuration:

Install Consul on all nodes in the cluster.
Configure Consul agents to participate in the leader election process.
Ensure Consul agents are correctly communicating with each other.
Leader Election Implementation:

Develop a session-based leader election process using Consul.
Write scripts to enable BDI and API services on the leader node.
Ensure non-leader nodes are watching for leadership changes.
Service Management Scripts:

Create scripts or systemd service files to start, stop, and monitor the BDI and API services.
Ensure these scripts are integrated with the leader election process.
Failover Testing:

Simulate leader node failures to test the failover mechanism.
Ensure that non-leader nodes can detect the failure, elect a new leader, and enable the necessary services.
Monitoring and Alerts Setup:

Set up monitoring for Consul leader status and service health.
Configure alerts to notify the operations team of any leadership changes or service issues.
Documentation:

Document the Consul setup, leader election process, and service management scripts.
Provide guidelines for future maintenance and troubleshooting of the leader election and failover mechanisms.
By meeting these acceptance criteria, the Safer Payment application will have a robust service management system with Consul-based leader election, ensuring high availability and automatic failover of critical services (BDI and API) in the cluster.
