Why RSocket Connections Might Not Be Equally Distributed:
Layer 4 Load Balancing: Consul's default behavior for Layer 4 services uses connection-level load balancing. This means that once a connection is established between the client and an upstream service, all traffic will flow through that connection. If connections are long-lived (which is typical in RSocket), the load balancing may appear uneven because some services may handle a disproportionate number of connections over time.

Persistent Connections: RSocket is designed for low-latency, real-time communication using a persistent connection. The traffic is routed per connection, not per request, leading to an unequal distribution of requests if the connections themselves are not evenly spread out.

Round-Robin and Least Connections: In Layer 4 load balancing, algorithms like round-robin or least connections are used. However, if the connections are sticky or not frequently torn down, the load can accumulate unevenly across services.

Potential Solutions:
Layer 7 Load Balancing: If possible, you can switch to Layer 7 (application layer) load balancing instead of Layer 4. Layer 7 allows Consul to route based on the actual application traffic (requests) rather than at the connection level, which leads to more equal distribution of traffic.

However, Layer 7 requires services that understand higher-level protocols (like HTTP) and might not be directly compatible with RSocket. You’d need to evaluate if this is suitable for your architecture.
Connection Pooling and Connection Closing: To mitigate the uneven distribution of connections, you can configure your clients to close and reopen connections periodically. This forces the service mesh to reallocate connections, which can result in a more balanced distribution.

Consul Configuration Adjustments: Depending on your specific setup, you can tune Consul’s service mesh configuration. For example:

Adjust connection limits to avoid overloading specific instances.
Enable retries in case of failures, which can distribute connections more evenly across services.
Consider using Envoy, Consul's default sidecar proxy, to enable features such as circuit breaking, outlier detection, and retry logic, which can improve the load distribution over time.
RSocket Load Balancer: If you are using RSocket in a microservice setup, RSocket itself provides client-side load balancing strategies that you can leverage. By using RSocket’s Load Balancer, you can ensure better distribution of requests across upstream services.

RSocket load balancers can use techniques like weighted random routing or round-robin, which can distribute requests more evenly regardless of the underlying transport connection.
