Feature Description:
Implement a rolling rehydration process for the 6-node AWS cluster, ensuring that nodes are rehydrated every 30 days without causing downtime for the entire cluster. Use Consul watch processes to manage the rehydration by sequentially disabling cluster services, quiescing nodes, and then terminating and relaunching instances. Ensure the API, BDI, and MCI services are rolled seamlessly.

Acceptance Criteria:
Consul Watch Process:

Consul must be configured to watch for rehydration events.
The watch process must sequentially manage each node in the cluster for rehydration.
Service Quiescing and Disabling:

Before terminating a node, ensure cluster services are disabled and the node is quiesced (not accepting new connections).
Ensure all active processes are completed or gracefully terminated.
Node Termination and Relaunch:

After disabling services, terminate the node and relaunch a new instance.
Ensure the new instance is correctly configured and rejoins the cluster.
Rolling Deployment:

Perform the rehydration process one node at a time to maintain cluster availability.
Ensure the cluster as a whole is never down, and the API, BDI, and MCI services are seamlessly rolled over.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Implement monitoring to track the status of the rehydration process.
Configure alerts to notify the operations team of any issues during rehydration.
Testing and Validation:

Perform end-to-end testing to validate the rolling rehydration process.
Ensure each node is correctly quiesced, terminated, and relaunched.
Validate that the API, BDI, and MCI services are not disrupted during the rehydration process.
Tasks:
Consul Configuration:

Configure Consul to watch for rehydration events.
Set up Consul to manage the sequential rehydration process.
Service Management Scripts:

Create scripts to disable cluster services and quiesce nodes.
Ensure scripts handle graceful termination of active processes.
Node Termination and Relaunch Automation:

Develop automation to terminate and relaunch instances via AWS.
Ensure new instances are correctly configured and automatically rejoin the cluster.
Rolling Deployment Implementation:

Implement the rolling rehydration process to handle one node at a time.
Ensure seamless transition of API, BDI, and MCI services.
Monitoring and Alerts Setup:

Set up monitoring to track the status of each node during rehydration.
Configure alerts to notify the operations team of any rehydration issues.
Testing and Validation:

Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the rehydration process works as expected.
Validate that cluster services are not disrupted and the rolling rehydration process maintains cluster availability.
Documentation:

Document the Consul watch process, service management scripts, and automation for node termination and relaunch.
Provide guidelines for future maintenance and troubleshooting of the rehydration process.
By meeting these acceptance criteria, the Safer Payment application will have a robust rolling rehydration process, ensuring that nodes are rehydrated every 30 days without causing downtime, and the API, BDI, and MCI services are maintained seamlessly throughout the rehydration process.
