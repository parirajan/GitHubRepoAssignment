# IBM Safer Payments Cluster in AWS GovCloud - Architectural Design

## Overview
The **IBM Safer Payments Cluster** in **AWS GovCloud** is designed to ensure continuous availability, fault tolerance, and data integrity for critical payment fraud prevention and post-settlement batch processing. This deployment spans multiple regions, incorporating a resilient architecture that leverages **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** for automated node recovery, ensuring operational continuity across **East** and **West** regions.

## 1. Region and Availability Zone (AZ) Layout
- **Regions**:
  - The deployment spans two AWS regions, **East** and **West**, providing regional redundancy to protect against region-wide failures.
  - Each region operates within its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), maintaining network isolation and independence.
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**:
  - Within each region, nodes are distributed across three Availability Zones (AZ-1, AZ-2, AZ-3).
  - This setup prevents a single AZ failure from impacting the entire region, allowing for fault-tolerant operations.
- **Purpose**:
  - By distributing nodes across multiple AZs, the design ensures high availability and localized fault tolerance, maintaining uninterrupted operations even if an AZ goes offline.

## 2. Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) and Node Deployment
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)**:
  - Each node within an AZ is part of an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**, which ensures resilient node recovery in the event of failures.
  - ASGs automatically detect node health, replacing failed nodes to maintain consistent operational capacity across the cluster without requiring manual intervention.
- **Node Deployment**:
  - There are three ASG-managed nodes in each region, with each node deployed in a separate AZ.
  - This distribution allows for balanced processing within each region, mitigating the impact of any single-node or AZ-level outage.
- **Resilience Benefits**:
  - ASGs enable self-healing capabilities, allowing for automated failover and recovery. This ensures that each region maintains its operational readiness, even during node or AZ outages, and provides a continuously available service.

## 3. Communication Interfaces
- **Status Control Interface (SCI)**:
  - **Purpose**: The SCI handles status monitoring and control message exchange, ensuring all nodes within and across regions maintain synchronized statuses.
- **Fast Link Interface (FLI)**:
  - **Purpose**: FLI is used to enable efficient and timely data synchronization across nodes, crucial for post-settlement fraud detection and maintaining data integrity.

## 4. Fault Tolerance and High Availability
- **Multi-Region and Multi-AZ Design**:
  - The design leverages a multi-region setup with nodes spread across multiple AZs, providing resilience against localized AZ or even region-level failures.
  - The use of two independent regions (East and West) further enhances the system’s ability to withstand catastrophic events, ensuring service continuity.
- **ASG-Enabled Resilience**:
  - ASGs provide automated node recovery, launching replacement nodes as needed to maintain the intended cluster capacity and health.
  - This feature supports a self-healing infrastructure that ensures minimal downtime and maximizes the system’s fault tolerance.
- **Robust Inter-Node Communication**:
  - The combination of SCI and FLI interfaces supports robust inter-node communication for status synchronization and data consistency, keeping the distributed cluster fully cohesive.

### Summary
The **IBM Safer Payments Cluster** in AWS GovCloud is architected to prioritize resilience, fault tolerance, and high availability. The use of a multi-region, multi-AZ deployment, combined with ASG-based automated recovery, provides a highly resilient infrastructure. The inclusion of SCI and FLI communication interfaces ensures that nodes remain synchronized and data consistency is maintained, supporting critical fraud prevention and data integrity across a distributed environment. This setup enables IBM Safer Payments to deliver a reliable, continuously available service in the face of localized outages or infrastructure failures.
