Feature Description:
Automate the installation and configuration of the Safer Payment software on the 6-node AWS cluster. This includes setting up paths and directories for data, configurations, and settings, as well as customizing and templatizing configuration files (settings.iris and cluster.iris). Use Ansible to provision the AMI with these configurations to ensure consistency across all nodes in the cluster.

Acceptance Criteria:
Software Installation:

Safer Payment software must be installed on each instance in the cluster.
Installation should be automated using Ansible playbooks.
Custom Configurations:

Paths and directories for Safer Payment data, configurations, and settings must be properly set up.
Directories must include locations for data storage, configuration files, logs, and any other necessary components.
Templatized Configuration Files:

Configuration files (settings.iris and cluster.iris) must be customized and templatized to be used across all nodes.
Templates should allow for node-specific configurations to be dynamically applied during provisioning.
Ansible Provisioning:

Ansible playbooks must be created to automate the entire provisioning process.
Playbooks should include tasks for installing the software, setting up directories, and applying configuration templates.
AMI Provisioning:

Ansible playbooks must be used to create a custom AMI with the Safer Payment software and configurations pre-installed.
The custom AMI should be used to launch instances in the cluster to ensure consistency and reduce setup time.
Testing and Validation:

Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the software is correctly installed and configured on all nodes.
Validate that all custom paths and directories are correctly set up and accessible.
Test the templatized configuration files to ensure they are correctly applied and functional on all nodes.
Tasks:
Ansible Playbook Development:

Create Ansible playbooks to automate the installation of the Safer Payment software.
Develop playbooks to set up custom paths and directories for data, configurations, and settings.
Configuration Templatization:

Create templates for settings.iris and cluster.iris configuration files.
Ensure templates can dynamically apply node-specific configurations during provisioning.
AMI Provisioning:

Use Ansible to create a custom AMI with the Safer Payment software and configurations pre-installed.
Ensure the AMI includes all necessary software, configurations, and directory structures.
Testing and Validation:

Deploy instances using the custom AMI and validate the installation and configuration.
Test the custom configurations and paths to ensure they are correctly set up and functional.
Validate the templatized configuration files by checking their application on all nodes.
Documentation:

Document the Ansible playbooks, configuration templates, and the AMI creation process.
Provide clear guidelines for future maintenance, updates, and scaling of the software and configurations.
By meeting these acceptance criteria, the Safer Payment application will be consistently and correctly installed and configured across all nodes in the cluster, ensuring a stable and reliable deployment environment.
