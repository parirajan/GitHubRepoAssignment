When a client receives an in-doubt response due to a tsvc timeout, it means the client never received a definitive answer on whether the write operation was successfully committed. In Aerospike’s design, here’s what can happen:

Uncertain Outcome:
The tsvc (transaction service) thread handling the write may have been delayed—often due to an underlying issue like high EBS latency. If the write completes after the client’s timeout, the record could be successfully written even though the client never received confirmation. Conversely, if the underlying issue (e.g., hardware problems with the EBS volume) prevents the write from ever reaching disk, the operation may indeed completely fail without persisting data.
Complete Failure Possibility:
In scenarios where the disk I/O is severely impacted, the transaction thread might not be able to commit the write at all. This means that despite the client’s in-doubt response, the write operation might ultimately fail entirely without any data being written to disk.
Client-Side Considerations:
Given this uncertainty, it’s important to verify the write operation with a subsequent read. If the record isn’t found after a few retries, it could indicate that the write never made it to disk, and then the client can decide whether to retry the write (with proper idempotency measures) or handle the failure accordingly.
In summary, yes—a write operation that triggers a tsvc timeout and returns an in-doubt status can indeed completely fail (i.e., without writing to disk) if the underlying issues prevent the transaction thread from completing its disk I/O operations.
