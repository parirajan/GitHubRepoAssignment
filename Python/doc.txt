1. Functional Testing (Automated & Manual)
Export Side:

Journal completeness: Ensure all actions/events are captured and no gaps exist in the journal sequence.
Ordering: Verify journal entries are exported in the correct timestamped order.
File correctness: Validate the structure and schema of exported journal files.
Retry/resume support: Test how the export process handles partial failures or retries.
Import Side (Consul Watch Triggered):

Correct KV update: Ensure that the date/time or journal ID update is done atomically.
Trigger validation: Confirm that the import script is triggered once and only once per update.
Sequencing: Test that journals are imported in the correct sequence and that older journals are skipped/prevented.
Idempotency: Confirm that re-running the same journal doesn’t cause duplicates or state corruption.
2. End-to-End Integration Testing
Set up a source and target cluster pair in a non-prod environment:

Perform full export → S3 → KV update → Import and verify data consistency and state replication between clusters.
Inject delays/failures (e.g., kill import process mid-way) to see how it resumes or reports errors.
3. Regression Testing
After major changes to the export/import scripts or API endpoints, validate that existing journal sequences are still valid and functional.
Ensure journal format/version is backward compatible if needed.
4. Data Integrity Testing
Checksum verification: Store checksums/hashes of journal files and verify post-transfer to S3 and before import.
Corruption testing: Deliberately corrupt a journal file and confirm that the import process halts gracefully with meaningful errors.
5. Negative Testing
Missing/malformed KV data in Consul.
Broken S3 paths or missing journal files.
API failures on the target cluster during import.
Out-of-sequence journal file injection attempts.
6. Performance Testing
Load testing: Simulate a large volume of journal entries and evaluate:
Export performance
Import script execution time
Consul watch performance under frequent updates
7. Security Testing
S3 access controls (correct IAM permissions)
Consul KV ACLs
Authentication for API calls during import
Tamper detection (was the journal altered after export?)
8. Observability Testing
Are logs meaningful and actionable (both for export and import)?
Are metrics available for:
Number of exported/imported entries
Failures and retries
Duration per journal processing
Are alerts triggered if import fails or stalls?
9. Roll-forward Testing
Since rollback is not possible, test scenarios where you miss one journal import and the next one is applied:
How is consistency affected?
Does the system detect and report skipped imports?
10. Disaster Recovery Testing
Backup of S3 journal exports.
Replay of past journals in a fresh cluster (simulated DR restore).
Manual re-trigger from Consul in case of failure recovery.



1. One-Time Setup

These are mostly infrastructure, configuration, and foundational tests you set up once:

Infrastructure Setup
S3 bucket creation with correct IAM roles and policies
Consul KV structure definition (e.g., keys for journal date/time)
Consul watch configuration on the target cluster
CI/CD pipelines for export/import scripts
Logging and monitoring setup (CloudWatch, ELK, Prometheus, etc.)
Initial Test Automation Setup
Unit & integration tests for:
Export script
Import script
API contract validation (both source & target)
Golden path end-to-end (E2E) automation with known data
Schema validation tests for journal files
Idempotency & retry test automation
2. Ongoing Automation (Scheduled or Triggered)

These activities happen on a schedule or in response to events, and should be tested continuously.

Export Cluster (Source)
Scheduled Export Script Execution (e.g., every 5 mins/hour)
Journal file upload to S3
Logging of export events (success/failure)
Target Cluster
Consul KV update process (could be part of the export script)
Consul watch mechanism that triggers import
Import script execution:
Reads journal file from S3
Makes API calls to apply changes
Logs success or failure
Automated Validations
File checksum or hash verification post-upload
File presence and format validation in S3
Consul KV verification post-update
Metrics/telemetry collection per journal
3. After Each Import Action (Per Journal)

These validations should run immediately after each import completes, automated as part of the import script or triggered pipeline:

Post-Import Validations
Journal integrity check:
All entries applied successfully
No partial or skipped entries
API response auditing:
Log and alert on any failed API calls
State verification:
Compare expected vs actual state if possible (hash-based or subset sampling)
Idempotency test (optional):
Optionally re-import the same journal in a test-only dry-run mode to verify no side effects
Logging and alerting:
Alert on failure, missing data, or suspicious anomalies (e.g., skipped journal dates)
KV cleanup or archival marking (if needed)
Bonus: Automation Infrastructure

CI/CD pipeline for:
Deploying and testing export/import scripts
Simulating real-world failures or retries
Synthetic test journal generation:
For load and regression testing in lower environments
