# Safer Payments Journal Promotion â€“ Automation Breakdown

This document classifies all automation tasks for the Safer Payments journal export/import mechanism into One-Time Setup, Ongoing Automation, and Post-Import Validations.

---

## 1. One-Time Setup

### Infrastructure
- Create S3 bucket with proper IAM access
- Configure Consul KV structure
- Define Consul watch on target cluster
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for export and import scripts
- Configure centralized logging and alerting

### Initial Testing Setup
- Unit and integration tests for scripts and API contracts
- Golden path E2E tests
- Schema validation tests
- Idempotency and retry test cases

---

## 2. Ongoing Automation

### Export Cluster (Source)
- Scheduled export job to generate and upload journals
- Logging and error handling
- Update Consul KV with latest journal metadata

### Target Cluster (Import Side)
- Consul watch triggers import script
- Script reads journal from S3 and calls API sequentially
- Import metrics and result logging

### Continuous Validations
- File presence and format checks in S3
- Checksum validation
- Consul KV correctness
- Metrics and alerts (success/failure, latency, etc.)

---

## 3. Post-Import Validation (Per Journal)

- Ensure all entries were applied correctly
- API response audit
- Validate system state (subset sampling or hash comparison)
- Optional dry-run reimport to validate idempotency
- Logging and alert generation on failures
- Optional: Archive or clean up processed KV entries

---

## Optional Automation Infrastructure

- CI/CD workflow for promotion pipelines
- Terraform scripts for repeatable infra provisioning
- Synthetic journal generation for testing
