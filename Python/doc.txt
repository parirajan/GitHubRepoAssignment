# SaferPayments Cluster Promotion Process

## **Overview**  
The SaferPayments platform follows a structured approach to generating, promoting, and securing models and configurations across different environments. This document outlines the process for cluster promotion, role assignments, and security considerations.

---

## **1. Cluster Transition and Configuration Generation**  

### **Development Cluster (ID-208 - devsandbox-model)**
- The **Cluster ID-208 (devsandbox-model)** will serve as the **source cluster** for generating configurations and models.
- All **source journals** will be created within this cluster.
- The models and configurations will be iteratively refined within **ID-208** until they are ready for promotion.

### **Production Cluster (ID-280 - Prod-model)**
- Once the models and configurations are validated, they will be promoted from **Cluster ID-208** to **Cluster ID-280 (Prod-model)**.
- After **Cluster ID-280** is **live**, the **export functionality** in **Cluster ID-208** will be **disabled (removed)** to ensure production integrity.

---

## **2. Role Assignments and Access Management**  

### **During Development Phase**
- The **Modeler** and **Modeler Manager** roles will be assigned to individual users within **Cluster ID-208**.
- These roles will have **full access** to perform necessary tasks such as model creation, query execution, and model promotions.

### **Production Transition and Access Control**
Once the promotion reaches the **production boundary (Cluster ID-280)**, access will be governed by a **Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval process**:

#### **Modeler Role**
- The **Modeler** role will have **CAB-approved standing access**.
- **Security policies and procedures** should be followed to validate access requirements.

#### **Modeler Manager Role**
- The **Modeler Manager** role will require **CAB-approved access** on a case-by-case basis.
- The **CAB request** must be **raised and approved** before access elevation.
- Once CAB approval is granted, an **FID process** is initiated to update the user's role to **Modeler Manager**.
- The **FID process** ensures controlled, auditable, and time-bound access elevation.

## **3. Summary of Cluster Transition and Role Management**  

| Stage                | Cluster ID  | Actions | Access Control |
|----------------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Development**      | **ID-208 (devsandbox-model)** | Generate configurations, create models, run queries, and investigations | Modeler & Modeler Manager roles assigned to individual users with **full access** |
| **Promotion**        | **ID-208 â†’ ID-280** | Promote models and journals to production | Managed via CAB approval |
| **Production (Live)** | **ID-280 (Prod-model)** | Models and configurations are live, export functionality from **ID-208 is disabled** | - **Modeler:** CAB-approved standing access <br> - **Modeler Manager:** Requires **CAB request & FID process** for elevation |

---

## **4. Security and Compliance Considerations**
- All access provisioning must comply with **security policies and procedures**.
- The **CAB request process** must be **documented and reviewed** periodically.
- **FID process logs** should be retained for audit and compliance tracking.
- Regular **access reviews** should be conducted to ensure **least privilege access** is maintained.

---

## **Conclusion**
This document outlines the structured approach to managing model transitions from **Cluster ID-208** to **Cluster ID-280**, ensuring a controlled and secure production rollout. The CAB process and FID-based access elevation ensure security and compliance while allowing necessary operational flexibility.
