- Data replication is set up for critical components.
- DR infrastructure is available in an alternate region.
- Failover mechanisms are tested periodically.

---

### **Feature 3: Automated Failover & Recovery**
**Description:**  
Implement **automation** for seamless failover and system recovery.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Automated failover mechanisms are configured and tested.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates are used for provisioning DR environments.
- Playbooks for manual recovery steps are documented.
- System monitoring detects failures and triggers automated responses.

---

### **Feature 4: DR Testing & Validation**
**Description:**  
Regular **DR testing** is conducted to validate recovery capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- DR drills are scheduled and executed.
- Failover testing scenarios are documented.
- Gaps and failures identified during testing are addressed.
- Compliance audits and reporting mechanisms are in place.

---

### **Feature 5: DR Runbooks & Post-Incident Review**
**Description:**  
Ensure operational teams have **documented runbooks** and perform **post-incident analysis** after DR events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Runbooks for different failure scenarios are available.
- Post-mortem reviews are conducted after DR events.
- Lessons learned are integrated into the DR process.
- DR documentation is continuously updated.

## **3. Sample User Stories Under Features**

### **Feature: DR Strategy & Planning**
**User Story 1: Define RTO/RPO for Critical Workloads**  
- **As a** Platform Owner,  
- **I want to** define **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** for critical services,  
- **So that** we can align DR efforts with business requirements.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - RTO and RPO values are defined and documented.
  - Business stakeholders approve DR objectives.

---

### **Feature: DR Infrastructure & Data Backup**
**User Story 2: Implement Data Backup Policy**
- **As a** Platform Engineer,  
- **I want to** implement **scheduled and automated backups** for databases and storage,  
- **So that** we can restore data in case of a failure.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Backups are taken at scheduled intervals.
  - Backup data retention policies are defined.
  - Restores are tested periodically.

---

### **Feature: Automated Failover & Recovery**
**User Story 3: Automate Failover to DR Site**
- **As a** DevOps Engineer,  
- **I want to** automate **failover mechanisms** for the application layer,  
- **So that** services remain available even in a disaster scenario.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Failover is triggered automatically upon detecting downtime.
  - DNS routing and traffic redirection to DR site are automated.
  - Failover tests are conducted every quarter.

---

### **Feature: DR Testing & Validation**
**User Story 4: Conduct Regular DR Drills**
- **As a** DR Coordinator,  
- **I want to** perform **disaster recovery drills** every 6 months,  
- **So that** we can verify DR readiness and identify gaps.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - DR drills are scheduled and executed.
  - Key services are validated during DR tests.
  - Post-test reports highlight failures and improvements.

---

### **Feature: DR Runbooks & Post-Incident Review**
**User Story 5: Maintain Up-to-Date DR Runbooks**
- **As a** SRE Team Member,  
- **I want to** maintain **updated DR runbooks**,  
- **So that** on-call engineers have clear recovery steps.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Runbooks cover application, database, and infrastructure recovery.
  - Runbooks are updated after every DR event or test.
  - Engineers have access to the latest version in a centralized repository.
